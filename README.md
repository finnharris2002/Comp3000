Dissertation repository of Finn Harris Web Security Handbook: Best practices for Testing and Securing websites in Typical Companies. 

Please note that my project was Research based meaning very little coding was performed.

The projects aims is to provide small companies/individuals with the knowledge and information about web security so that theyre equipped to protect their own website. 

orignially a website was made with the intention of testing and securing the website for demonstration. This deemed ineaffective so i looked elsewhere for development.


In this github repositroy you well encounter peices of code that were used in the development of the Hand book.
